## Countries with suppliers or customers, version 3

### Exercice:

The output of the above is improved, but it’s still not ideal
What we’d really like to see is the country name, the total suppliers, and the total customers

### Expected Results:

| Country       | TotalSuppliers | TotalCustomers |

### Hint

You should be able to use the above query, and make a few changes to the CTE source queries to show the total number of Supplier countries and Customer countries. You won’t be able to use the Distinct keyword anymore.

When joining the 2 CTEs together, you can use a computed column, with the IsNull function to show a non-null Country field, instead of the Supplier country or the Customer country.
