##  Late orders vs. total orders

### Exercice:

Andrew, the VP of sales, has been doing some more thinking some more about the problem of late orders. He realizes that just looking at the number of orders arriving late for each salesperson isn't a good idea. It needs to be compared against the total number of orders per salesperson. Return results like the following:

### Expected Results:
 
| EmployeeID | LastName  | AllOrders | LateOrders |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | Davolio   | 123       | 3          |
| 2          | Fuller    | 96        | 4          |
| 3          | Leverling | 127       | 5          |
| 4          | Peacock   | 156       | 10         |
| 6          | Suyama    | 67        | 3          |
| 7          | King      | 72        | 4          |
| 8          | Callahan  | 104       | 5          |
| 9          | Dodsworth | 43        | 5          |

### Hint

You can use more than one CTE in a query. That would be a straightforward way of solving this problem.

Here are 2 SQL statements that could be put into CTEs and put together into a final SQL statement.

```sql
-- Late orders
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    TotalOrders = COUNT(*)
FROM
    Orders
WHERE
    RequiredDate <= ShippedDate
GROUP BY
    EmployeeID;

-- Total orders
SELECT
    EmployeeID,
    TotalOrders = COUNT(*)
FROM
    Orders
GROUP BY
    EmployeeID;
```
