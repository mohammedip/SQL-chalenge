## Orders - accidental double-entry details, derived table

### Exercice:

Here's another way of getting the same results as in the previous problem, using a derived table instead of a CTE. However, there's a bug in this SQL. It returns 20 rows instead of 16. Correct the SQL.
### Problem SQL

```sql
SELECT
    OrderDetails.OrderID,
    ProductID,
    UnitPrice,
    Quantity,
    Discount
FROM
    OrderDetails
    JOIN (
        SELECT
            OrderID
        FROM
            OrderDetails
        WHERE
            Quantity >= 60
        GROUP BY
            OrderID,
            Quantity
        HAVING
            COUNT(*) > 1
    ) PotentialProblemOrders ON PotentialProblemOrders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
ORDER BY
    OrderID,
    ProductID;
```

### Hint

Your first step should be to run the SQL in the derived table
```sql
SELECT
    OrderID
FROM
    OrderDetails
WHERE
    Quantity >= 60
GROUP BY
    OrderID,
    Quantity
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```
What do you notice about the results?

There are 2 rows for OrderID 10263, because there are 2 sets of rows that have the same, identical quantity, that's 60 or above.
When you do a join to a table that has duplicates, you will get duplicates in the output as well, unless you take steps to avoid it.
Find a single keyword that you can easily add to avoid duplicates in SQL.
