## High-value customers - total orders

### Exercice:

The manager has changed his mind. Instead of requiring that customers have at least one individual orders totaling $10,000 or more, he wants to define high-value customers as those who have orders totaling $15,000 or more in 2016. How would you change the answer to the problem above?

### Expected Results:
