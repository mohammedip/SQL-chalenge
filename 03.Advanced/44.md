##  Late orders vs. total orders - missing employee

### Exercice:

There's an employee missing in the answer from the problem above. Fix the SQL to show all employees who have taken orders.


### Expected Results:
 
| EmployeeID | LastName  | AllOrders | LateOrders |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | Davolio   | 123       | 3          |
| 2          | Fuller    | 96        | 4          |
| 3          | Leverling | 127       | 5          |
| 4          | Peacock   | 156       | 10         |
| 5          | Buchanan  | 42        | NULL       |
| 6          | Suyama    | 67        | 3          |
| 7          | King      | 72        | 4          |
| 8          | Callahan  | 104       | 5          |
| 9          | Dodsworth | 43        | 5          |

(9 row(s) affected)

### Hint

How many rows are returned when you run just the AllOrders CTE?
How about when you run just the LateOrders CTE?

You'll want to add a left join (also known as a left outer join), to make sure that we show a row, even if there are no late orders.
