### Hint

There are many ways of doing this, including CTE (common table expression) and derived tables. I suggest using a CTE and a subquery.
Here's a good article on CTEs !(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16&redirectedfrom=MSDN)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16&redirectedfrom=MSDN]

This is an example of a simple CTE in Northwind. It returns orders made by the oldest employee:

```sql
WITH OldestEmployee AS (
    SELECT TOP 1
        EmployeeID
    FROM
        Employees
    ORDER BY
        BirthDate
)
SELECT
    OrderID,
    OrderDate
FROM
    Orders
WHERE
    EmployeeID IN (SELECT EmployeeID FROM OldestEmployee);
```
