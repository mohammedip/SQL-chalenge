### Hint

To start out, just use the OrderDetails table. You'll need to figure out how the Discount field is structured.

You should have something like this:

```sql
SELECT
    OrderID,
    ProductID,
    UnitPrice,
    Quantity,
    Discount,
    TotalWithDiscount = UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - Discount)
FROM
    OrderDetails;
```
Note that Discount is applied as a percentage. So, if there's a 0.15 in the discount field, you need to multiply the UnitPrice * Quantity by .85 (1.00 - .15). You need parenthesis around (1 - Discount) to make sure that calculation is done first.
