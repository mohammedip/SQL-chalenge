## First order in each country

### Exercice:

Looking at the Orders table—we’d like to show details for each order that was the first in that particular country, ordered by OrderID.
So, we need one row per ShipCountry, and CustomerID, OrderID, and OrderDate should be of the first order from that country.


### Expected Results:

|--------------|------------|---------|-----------|

### Hint

Your first step will probably be to create a query like this:
```sql
SELECT
    ShipCountry,
    CustomerID,
    OrderID,
    OrderDate = CONVERT(date, OrderDate)
FROM orders
ORDER BY
    ShipCountry,
    OrderID;
```
which shows all the rows in the Order table, sorted first by Country and then by OrderID.

Your next step is to create a computed column that shows the row number for each order, partitioned appropriately.
There’s a class of functions called Window functions or Ranking functions that you can use for this problem. Specifically, use the Row_Number() function, with the Over and Partition clause, to get the number, per country, of a particular order.

You’ll have something like this:
```sql
SELECT
    ShipCountry,
    CustomerID,
    OrderID,
    OrderDate = CONVERT(date, OrderDate),
    RowNumberPerCountry = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ShipCountry ORDER BY ShipCountry, OrderID)
FROM Orders;
```
Because of some limitations with Window functions, you can’t directly filter the computed column created above. Use a CTE to solve the problem.
