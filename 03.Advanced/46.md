### Hint

By dividing late orders by total orders, you should be able to get the percentage of orders that are late. However, there's a common problem people run into, which is that an integer divided by an integer returns an integer. For instance, if you run the following SQL to divide 3 by 2:
```sql
SELECT 3/2
```
Youâ€™ll get 1 instead of 1.5, because it will return the closest integer.
Do some research online to find the answer to this issue.
