##  Customer grouping - flexible

### Exercice:

Andrew, the VP of Sales is still thinking about how best to group customers, and define low, medium, high, and very high value customers. He now wants complete flexibility in grouping the customers, based on the dollar amount they've ordered. He doesn’t want to have to edit SQL in order to change the boundaries of the customer groups.
How would you write the SQL?
There's a table called CustomerGroupThreshold that you will need to use. Use only orders from 2016.

### Expected Results:
(The expected results are the same as for the original problem, it’s just that we’re getting the answer differently.)

### Hint

As a starting point, use the SQL of the first CTE from the problem
“Customer grouping with percentage”
```sql
SELECT
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.CompanyName,
    TotalOrderAmount = SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice)
FROM Customers
JOIN Orders
    ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails
    ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
WHERE
    OrderDate >= '2016-01-01'
    AND OrderDate < '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.CompanyName;
```
When thinking about how to use the table CustomerGroupThreshold, note that when joining to a table, you don't need to only use an equi-join (i.e., “=“ in the join). You can also use other operators, such as between, and greater than/less than (> and <).
