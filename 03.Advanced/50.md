### Hint

As a starting point, you can use the answer from the problem “Customer grouping - fix null”.
We no longer need to show the CustomerID and CompanyName in the final output. However, we need to count how many customers are in each CustomerGrouping. You can create another CTE level in order to get the counts in each CustomerGrouping for the final output.
