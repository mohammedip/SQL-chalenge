## High-value customers

### Exercice:

We want to send all of our high-value customers a special VIP gift.
We're defining high-value customers as those who've made at least 1 order with a total value (not including the discount) equal to $10,000 or more. We only want to consider orders made in the year 2016.

### Expected Results:

| CustomerID | CompanyName                      | OrderID | TotalOrderAmount |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------|------------------|

### Hint

First, let's get the necessary fields for all orders made in the year 2016.
Don't bother grouping yet, just work on the Where clause. You'll need the CustomerID, CompanyName from Customers; OrderID from Orders; and Quantity and unit price from OrderDetails. Order by the total amount of the order, in descending order.

You should have something like this:
```sql
SELECT
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.CompanyName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    Amount = Quantity * UnitPrice
FROM
    Customers
    JOIN Orders ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
    JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
WHERE
    OrderDate >= '20160101'
    AND OrderDate < '20170101';
```
This gives you the total amount for each Order Detail item in 2016 orders, at the Order Detail level. Now, which fields do you need to group on, and which need to be summed?

```sql
SELECT
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.CompanyName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    TotalOrderAmount = SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice)
FROM
    Customers
    JOIN Orders ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
    JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
WHERE
    OrderDate >= '20160101'
    AND OrderDate < '20170101'
GROUP BY
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.CompanyName,
    Orders.OrderID;
```

The fields at the Customer and Order level need to be grouped by, and the TotalOrderAmount needs to be summed.
How would you filter on the sum, in order to get orders of $10,000 or more? Can you put it straight into the where clause?
