## Orders - accidental double-entry

### Exercice:

Janet Leverling, one of the salespeople, has come to you with a request.
She thinks that she accidentally double-entered a line item on an order, with a different ProductID, but the same quantity. She remembers that the quantity was 60 or more. Show all the OrderIDs with line items that match this, in order of OrderID

### Expected Results:
 
| OrderID |
|---------|
| 10263   |
| 10263   |
| 10990   |
| 10658   |
| 11030   |

(5 row(s) affected)

### Hint

You might start out with something like this:

```sql
SELECT
    OrderID,
    ProductID,
    Quantity
FROM
    OrderDetails
WHERE
    Quantity >= 60;
```
However, this will only give us the orders where at least one order detail has a quantity of 60 or more. We need to show orders with more than one order detail with a quantity of 60 or more. Also, the same value for quantity needs to be there more than once.

In addition to grouping on the OrderID, we also need to group by the Quantity, since we need to show the order details that have the same quantity, within an order. So, we need to group by both OrderID, and Quantity.
