## Orders - random assortment

### Exercice:

The Northwind mobile app developers would now like to just get a random assortment of orders for beta testing on their app. Show a random set of 2% of all orders.


### Expected Results:

(note - your results will be different, because weâ€™re returning a random
 set)
 
| OrderID |
|---------|
| 11034   |
| 10400   |
| 10948   |
| 10931   |
| 10942   |
| 10604   |
| 10350   |
| 10499   |
| 10927   |
| 10896   |
| 10774   |
| 10932   |
| 10592   |
| 10706   |
| 10479   |
| 10782   |
| 10898   |

(17 row(s) affected)

### Hint

Note that in the below SQL, the RandomValue field returns the same random value for each row. Do some research online to figure out how to get a new random value for each row.

```sql
SELECT
    OrderID,
    RandomValue = RAND()
FROM
    Orders;
```
