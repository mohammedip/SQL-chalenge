### Hint

A good way to start would be with a list of countries from the Suppliers table, and a list of countries from the Customers table. Use either
Distinct or Group by to avoid duplicating countries. Sort by country name

You should have something like this:
```sql
 SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
 SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Suppliers;
```
You can combine these with a CTEs or derived tables.
Note that there’s a specific type of outer join you’ll need, designed to return rows from either resultset.  What is it? Look online for the different types of outer join available.
